#### Unofficial [Habitica](http://habitica.com/) desktop app

Built for OS X, created with Electron. I found that having to open a fully-functioning browser to check off tasks on a productivity app to be a dangerous thing, so I broke it out into its own isolated Electron browser. Plus, nothing beats `âŒ˜+space`ing to something.

#### Installation

[Download the release](https://github.com/ZachGawlik/desktop-habitica/releases/download/1.0.0/Habitica-1.0.0.app.zip), and move `Habitica.app` into your Applications directory.

Alternatively, you can build it yourself by getting the source, running `npm install && npm run build`, and opening the app found inside the `dist` folder.
